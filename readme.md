# PancakesCon V: AI in Infosec and Birding
## References
For PancakesCon V, I discussed birding, the use of AI in birding, and the use of AI in infosec with some examples. You can find the slides in this repository, and links to the sources (including GitHub repositories for tools) here.

## Birding tools
[eBird, Cornell Lab of Ornithology](https://ebird.org/home), a website and app for sharing information on bird sightings.

[Merlin app, Cornell Lab of Ornithology](https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/), a bird identification app 

[All About Birds online guide](https://allaboutbirds.org), an online bird identification guide.

## AI tools for infosec
[StreamingPhish](https://github.com/wesleyraptor/streamingphish) : a Certificate Transparency Log scanning ML tool to search for phishing sites. Repository requires docker for deployment

[YaraML Rules generator](https://github.com/sophos/yaraml_rules) - open source toolkit and samples for generating YARA rules from malware samples.

[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) An environment for data analysis and Machine Learning.

[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/_) A good Python library to start off with for working with ML / AI.
